For the create section of this project, I decided to implement a trainer management system for administrators. Admin users can both create and delete trainers within the program. It includes all the functionality of the default trainers, including file upload capabilities. On the manage trainers page, administrators cannot delete trainers who have courses assigned to them. I found a helpful tooltip popup on Stack Overflow that I implemented to notify admins of this restriction, along with disabling the delete button.
